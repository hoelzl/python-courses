"""
The core infrastructure of the Othellite game.

## Main Classes

These are the main classes that comprise the core of the game.

- `Board`: Base class of all board implementations
- `Field`: A single field on a board
- `Game`: Interface for implementing the game
- `Player`: Representation of a player, either human or automated

## Utility Classes

These classes make use of certain utility classes and enumeration:

- `Position`: A position on a board
- `Direction`: Representation of compass directions
- `Score`: Type for mapping field types to the number of corresponding fields on
  the board
- `GameResult` and `WinReason`: Description of a game's outcome
- `Notifier`: Observer to communicate the progress of the game and its outcome
  to interested parties
- `MulticastNotifier`: Composite notifier that delegates methods to its members
- `PlayerColor`: The color of a player

## Hexagonal Architecture

This module is the core of the hexagonal architecture. It should not depend on
any other modules in the `othellite` package.
